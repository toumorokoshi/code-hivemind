## ALWAYS RUN

- study the README.md
- as needed later in the task, read the appropriate specification from the
  `specs/` directory.
- if there is an follow-up or todo item, create an issue for it as described in
  [Issue Management](#issue-management).
- grep `design/` for any relevant keywords to the task you are implementing.
  Study the matching files and adhere to the best practices described.
- Always run linting and formatting before committing.

## Branch cleanup

When starting work, the branch should be clean, and you should try pull the
latest changes from the primary upstream branch before continuing.

## Add and update documentation

Always add and update documentation as appropriate. Update at least the following:

- any relevant files in the `docs/` directory.
- any updated designs and considerations in the `specs/` directory.

## Issue Management

File issues liberally to help keep context minimal and focus on your current
task.

- Issues are managed via the `bd` commmand line.
- Issues are created via `bd create`
  - Priority should be set to the following (P2 otherwise):
    - P0: Any required project fundamentals or initialization

## Committing code

- **unless** the prompt contains "don't commit", commit the code.
- **unless** the prompt contains "don't push", push the code.

- Use the conventional commit format for commit messages.
- The commit description must explain the problem first.
- The commit description must a summary of each area modified.

## Linting

- Always run linting and formatting before committing.
- Formatting and lint fixing tools are available via `just fix`.
- Linting tools are available via `just lint`.

## Testing

- linting, formatting, and testing **must** pass before a commit.
- add unit tests for every change if possible.

## CI

CI **must** pass after every commit.

To verify CI status, use the GitHub MCP server.

## Code Design

The following code tenants are followed:

- functional programming as much as possible.
- separate state from functional programming.
- re-use code as much as possible.
- leverage best-practice third party libraries.

## Examples

- example data is in the `examples/` directory.
